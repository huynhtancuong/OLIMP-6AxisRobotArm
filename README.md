# OLIMP-6AxisRobotArm
This is a repository for storing diary, code, and how we research about a 6 axis robot arm in OLIMP Club (ITMO)

## History of work
### Day 1
* We received the parts of the robot arm, which was disassembled. So we search for instruction on youtube so as to assemble it. 
* This is a open source 6 axis robot arm project. Its name is THOR. 
* Some parts are missing and some of them were broken, so we have to glue them together. 
* Link to THOR open source project: http://thor.angel-lm.com/
* We got some trouble with add-on when open the 3D-model of the project with FreeCAD, but after all we can open it without error
